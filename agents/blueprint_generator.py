This module converts a high‑level blueprint (e.g. JSON or YAML) into code for the
frontend and backend.  Originally this logic lived in `ai/blueprint/generator.py`.

The goal is to emulate Lovable.dev’s ability to generate full‑stack code from a
single prompt【955008867522803†L90-L106】.  In a real implementation this function
would parse the blueprint, orchestrate calls to the different agents and write
files into `frontend/` and `backend/`.
